Overview

The Hangman Game is a Swift app that lets users play the classic word-guessing game. In this game, users start with an empty noose image and enter a word to guess. The word is hidden with underscores, and the user guesses one letter at a time. If a guessed letter is correct, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the letter, and the screen background turns green. If the guess is incorrect, the screen background turns red, and a body part is added to the hanged man image. The game continues until the user either correctly guesses the entire word or loses by completing the hanged man.

Correct Guess: If the guessed letter is correct, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the letter, and the screen background turns green.
